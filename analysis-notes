Packet_Capture_Baseline.png:
The capture consists primarily of IPv4 traffic with a mix of TCP and UDP protocols. 
Encrypted traffic (TLS and QUIC) accounts for a significant portion of sessions, consistent with modern web browsing behavior. 
DNS queries are low in volume and show normal domain lengths and request/response patterns. 
No signs of automated beaconing, excessive retries, or anomalous protocol usage were observed.
Used my own home network for this. 

The following analysis is from a online PCAP.


smb_tcp_analysis.png:
Identified repeated short-lived TCP connections from a single internal host to SMB ports (445/139), indicating SMB enumeration rather than normal file-sharing activity.

smb_analysis.png:
Observed one internal host initiating connections across multiple enterprise service ports (SMB, LDAP, RPC, HTTP/HTTPS), consistent with internal service discovery.

smb_scanning_behavior.png:
Detected multiple SYN-only TCP packets to internal hosts and common service ports, indicating reconnaissance or scanning activity.

smb_session_setup_request.png:
Captured SMB2 session setup and NTLM authentication attempts with IPC$ access, commonly used during internal enumeration and early lateral movement.

03-beaconing_graph.png:
I/O graphs were reviewed to identify periodic outbound traffic; no consistent beaconing patterns were observed. 
Beaconing behavior would mean the same height in spikes, same spacing, and would run for a longer time.

04-TLS_SNI.png:
Captured and analyzed a TLS 1.2 Client Hello over TCP port 443 using Wireshark. 
Identified the Server Name Indication (SNI) value client.wns.windows.com, showing the destination domain before encryption. 
Examined TLS handshake parameters including supported cipher suites, extensions, and elliptic curves. 
Extracted the JA3 fingerprint and full JA3 string from the Client Hello, demonstrating how encrypted traffic can still be fingerprinted and correlated for detection and threat hunting without decrypting payload data.
